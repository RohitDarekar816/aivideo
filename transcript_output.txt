[00:00:00 - 00:00:06] Each new day and every new year brings with it a profound assurance.
[00:00:06 - 00:00:09] God walks ahead of us.
[00:00:09 - 00:00:15] Picture embarking on a journey through a wild and uncharted wilderness,
[00:00:15 - 00:00:21] guided by a torchbearer who not only illuminates your path,
[00:00:21 - 00:00:26] but also removes every hindrance, ensuring a safe journey.
[00:00:26 - 00:00:30] This is the essence of having God lead us.
[00:00:30 - 00:00:38] He prepares the way, smooths the rough terrain, and dismantles barriers.
[00:00:38 - 00:00:45] Today, I want to delve into how the Lord's guidance shapes our journeys,
[00:00:45 - 00:00:50] alleviates our doubts, and secures our triumphs.
[00:00:50 - 00:00:55] I will also join you in a powerful prayer in the mighty name of Jesus,
[00:00:55 - 00:01:01] so stay with me until the end and open your hearts to the blessings that await you.
[00:01:02 - 00:01:04] Isaiah 45-2 assures us,
[00:01:05 - 00:01:09] I will go before you and make the crooked places straight.
[00:01:09 - 00:01:14] I will break in pieces the gates of bronze and cut the bars of iron.
[00:01:14 - 00:01:17] This promise reveals a profound truth.
[00:01:18 - 00:01:21] God does not merely accompany us.
[00:01:21 - 00:01:27] He leads the way, removing obstacles and opening doors that no one can close.
[00:01:28 - 00:01:32] Let's explore the significance of God's preparation.
[00:01:33 - 00:01:39] When we invite the Lord to go before us, we embrace a divine assurance
[00:01:39 - 00:01:42] that He is already working on our behalf.
[00:01:42 - 00:01:50] No situation is too complex, and no challenge is too daunting for his preparation to handle.
[00:01:50 - 00:01:55] We often envision life as a path we must forge ourselves,
[00:01:55 - 00:02:03] but the reality is that God has already traversed ahead, making provisions we may not yet see.
[00:02:03 - 00:02:11] Take, for instance, the widow of the prophet Obediah in two kings, four to one negative seven,
[00:02:12 - 00:02:17] who faced a dire predicament with creditors threatening to enslave her sons.
[00:02:17 - 00:02:26] She may have felt utterly forsaken, yet God had already paved a way through her faith and obedience.
[00:02:26 - 00:02:33] When she sought divine assistance, the oil in her jar became the means of her deliverance.
[00:02:33 - 00:02:41] God's preparation didn't erase her struggles, but provided a solution that magnified his glory.
[00:02:42 - 00:02:45] Isaiah 48-17 states,
[00:02:45 - 00:02:52] I am the Lord your God who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way you should go.
[00:02:52 - 00:02:59] This verse reminds us that God not only goes before us, but also guides us along the way,
[00:02:59 - 00:03:08] ensuring we align with His plans. In times of uncertainty, we must remember that God's preparation
[00:03:08 - 00:03:17] often transcends human understanding. He orchestrates people, events, and circumstances to fulfill His
[00:03:17 - 00:03:26] purpose in our lives. Consider the story of Jonathan's armor-bearer in one Samuel 14-6-14.
[00:03:27 - 00:03:34] Jonathan, driven by faith, declared that God could save by many or by few,
[00:03:35 - 00:03:42] and His armor bearer trusted in God's unseen preparations. Despite being outnumbered,
[00:03:42 - 00:03:50] they acted on faith, and God caused confusion among their enemies, granting them victory.
[00:03:50 - 00:03:56] This illustrates how God's preparation was already in place for their triumph,
[00:03:57 - 00:04:04] even when it appeared impossible from a human standpoint. God's preparation is not confined
[00:04:04 - 00:04:13] to grand battles or miraculous rescues. It is intricately woven into the everyday details of our lives.
[00:04:13 - 00:04:19] He redies our hearts, minds, and spirits for the tasks ahead,
[00:04:20 - 00:04:28] equipping us to stand firm, even amid uncertainty. Proverbs 16-9 tells us,
[00:04:28 - 00:04:34] a man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps.
[00:04:36 - 00:04:45] This truth serves as a reminder that our limited understanding pales in comparison to God's infinite wisdom.
[00:04:46 - 00:04:54] We may only see the next step, but he sees the entire journey. Have you ever reflected on a situation
[00:04:54 - 00:05:00] and realized that everything fell into place perfectly, even when it felt chaotic at the time?
[00:05:01 - 00:05:09] This is the evidence of God's preparation working silently yet powerfully to fulfill His purposes.
[00:05:09 - 00:05:15] His preparation often calls us to trust Him in ways that stretch our faith.
[00:05:15 - 00:05:24] Think of the servant in Genesis 24-10-27, who was tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.
[00:05:25 - 00:05:32] He prayed for God to reveal His plan, and before He finished praying, Rebecca appeared,
[00:05:32 - 00:05:40] fulfilling His specific requests. God's preparation had already gone ahead of the servant's journey,
[00:05:40 - 00:05:46] ensuring success before He even set out. This same God goes before you today.
[00:05:47 - 00:05:55] You may feel uncertain, overwhelmed, or unprepared, but remember that God's preparation does not
[00:05:55 - 00:06:02] rely on your strength or understanding. It is rooted in His love for you, and His desire to see
[00:06:02 - 00:06:09] His promises fulfilled in your life. Even when the path ahead seems unclear,
[00:06:10 - 00:06:16] trust that He has already cleared the way, Isaiah 41-10 reassures us,
[00:06:17 - 00:06:26] fair not for I am with you. Be not dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Yes,
[00:06:26 - 00:06:31] I will help you. I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
[00:06:32 - 00:06:40] This promise reminds us that we do not walk alone. God's preparation surrounds us with His strength
[00:06:40 - 00:06:48] and guidance. Sometimes His preparation involves closing doors we desperately want to walk through.
[00:06:49 - 00:06:55] While it may be painful in the moment, those closed doors are part of His divine plan,
[00:06:55 - 00:07:03] leading us to greater blessings. When we surrender our plans to Him, we allow Him to align
[00:07:03 - 00:07:11] every step with His perfect will. God's preparation is not constrained by time, resources,
[00:07:11 - 00:07:19] or human limitations. He is always timely, and His provision is always sufficient. No matter where
[00:07:19 - 00:07:28] you find yourself today, know that God is already at work, orchestrating every detail for your good
[00:07:28 - 00:07:36] and His glory. Let us place our trust in the one who prepares the way, confident that His plans
[00:07:36 - 00:07:43] far exceed anything we could envision. When God goes before us, He doesn't just prepare the way,
[00:07:44 - 00:07:52] He walks with us every step of the journey. This is the assurance of God's presence. His presence
[00:07:52 - 00:08:00] is not a fleeting moment, but a constant source of help offering guidance, strength, and peace.
[00:08:01 - 00:08:07] A powerful example of this can be found in the story of King Hisakaya during the siege of Jerusalem,
[00:08:08 - 00:08:16] as recounted in two kings, 1932, negative 36. Faced with a formidable enemy,
[00:08:17 - 00:08:23] Hisakaya prayed earnestly, and God's response showcased His active presence.
[00:08:24 - 00:08:31] In one night, the angel of the Lord struck down the enemy army, securing victory for His people
[00:08:31 - 00:08:39] without them lifting a single weapon. God didn't just prepare the way, He manifested His presence
[00:08:39 - 00:08:46] in their deliverance. This story serves as a reminder that when we trust God to lead us,
[00:08:47 - 00:08:53] we are never left to face our battles alone. Psalm 23 to 4 declares,
[00:08:54 - 00:09:00] Ye, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[00:09:01 - 00:09:08] For you are with me, you're rod and your staff. They comfort me. This encapsulates the essence of
[00:09:08 - 00:09:16] God's presence, providing comfort in trials and assurance in uncertainties. When we allow Him to
[00:09:16 - 00:09:25] lead, His presence becomes our shield, guide, and source of strength. Consider the Samaritan woman
[00:09:25 - 00:09:34] at the well in John 4 to 7 negative 26. Her encounter with Jesus was not coincidental. It was a
[00:09:34 - 00:09:42] divinely orchestrated moment where God's presence transformed her life. In that instant, she experienced
[00:09:42 - 00:09:50] the fullness of His grace, as her shame was replaced with hope and purpose. This same presence is
[00:09:50 - 00:09:58] available to us, offering renewal and direction when we feel lost or burdened. God's presence is
[00:09:58 - 00:10:05] not confined to grand displays of power. It is often found in the quiet moments of our lives.
[00:10:06 - 00:10:15] In Exodus 33 to 14, God promises, My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.
[00:10:16 - 00:10:24] This assurance is not just for Moses, but for all who trust in the Lord to guide their steps.
[00:10:24 - 00:10:32] Resting in His presence means more than physical relaxation. It encompasses the deep peace that
[00:10:32 - 00:10:39] comes from knowing He is in control. When life feels overwhelming, His presence reassures us that
[00:10:39 - 00:10:46] we are not alone. Have there been moments when you felt incapable of managing the weight of your
[00:10:46 - 00:10:53] responsibilities? God's presence does not eliminate challenges, but empowers you to overcome them
[00:10:53 - 00:11:05] with His strength. In Joshua 1 to 9, God commands, have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage,
[00:11:05 - 00:11:13] do not be afraid nor dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. This is the
[00:11:13 - 00:11:20] confidence we find in His presence, enabling us to face every situation with courage because He is
[00:11:20 - 00:11:28] by our side. God's presence also serves as a guide, leading us when the way is unclear.
[00:11:29 - 00:11:37] In Acts 16 to 6, negative 10, Paul and his companions were prevented by the Holy Spirit
[00:11:37 - 00:11:44] from entering certain regions. This was not a rejection, but a divine redirection. As God's
[00:11:45 - 00:11:52] presence led them to Macedonia, where people were ready to receive His Word. This story illustrates
[00:11:52 - 00:11:59] that God's presence is not confined to our plans. It transcends our understanding to fulfill
[00:11:59 - 00:12:06] His greater purpose. Have you ever experienced a closed door that turned out to be a blessing in
[00:12:06 - 00:12:16] disguise? I certainly have. This is the work of God's presence, ensuring that every step aligns
[00:12:16 - 00:12:26] with His will for our lives. In times of uncertainty, it is His presence that provides clarity and peace.
[00:12:26 - 00:12:33] He walks ahead of us, not only clearing a path, but also accompanying us to keep us on course.
[00:12:34 - 00:12:42] Isaiah 43 to 2 reassures us, when you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and through the
[00:12:42 - 00:12:51] rivers they shall not overflow you. This promise reveals the depth of God's commitment to us,
[00:12:51 - 00:12:59] even in the most challenging seasons. He does not promise a life devoid of trials, but offers a
[00:12:59 - 00:13:06] presence that sustains us through them. At times, we may struggle to sense God's presence,
[00:13:06 - 00:13:14] especially during difficult seasons. Yet, just as the sun remains steadfast behind the clouds,
[00:13:14 - 00:13:22] God's presence never wavers. Even when we cannot see or feel it, He is with us in joy and sorrow,
[00:13:22 - 00:13:30] in triumph and trial. His presence is a constant reminder that we are not forgotten or forsaken.
[00:13:30 - 00:13:36] When we acknowledge His presence, our faith is strengthened and our perspective shifts.
[00:13:37 - 00:13:44] We begin to view challenges as opportunities for His glory to shine through. Are you navigating
[00:13:44 - 00:13:52] a season of uncertainty today? Remember that God's presence is not dictated by your feelings,
[00:13:52 - 00:13:58] but by His promise. He has declared, I will never leave you nor forsake you,
[00:13:59 - 00:14:08] and His word is unfailing. Trust in His presence to guide, sustain, and bring you peace.
[00:14:08 - 00:14:15] Whether you stand at the brink of a decision or traverse a valley, know that the God who goes
[00:14:15 - 00:14:23] before you is also beside you. His presence is your assurance that you are never alone.
[00:14:23 - 00:14:30] Now, let's focus on the victory found in God's guidance. When God leads us,
[00:14:31 - 00:14:39] He not only prepares the way and assures us of His presence, but also guides us to victory.
[00:14:39 - 00:14:44] Victory through God's guidance may not always be immediate or easily understood,
[00:14:44 - 00:14:53] but it is always assured. A profound truth is found in two Chronicles 2017,
[00:14:53 - 00:14:59] which states, you will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves,
[00:14:59 - 00:15:07] stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you. This promise highlights the power
[00:15:07 - 00:15:13] of surrendering to God's guidance and trusting that His ways are higher than ours.
[00:15:14 - 00:15:20] Victory begins with obedience, even when the path seems unconventional.
[00:15:20 - 00:15:30] Consider the widow's son in one King's 1717-24. When her son fell ill and died,
[00:15:30 - 00:15:38] her world shattered. However, God's guidance through His servant Elijah led to the miraculous
[00:15:38 - 00:15:46] restoration of the boy's life. This victory was not solely about in moments of impending disaster.
[00:15:47 - 00:15:54] Divine guidance can intervene, even when we are unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.
[00:15:55 - 00:16:01] Just as God opened the eyes of the dawn to avert destruction, His relentless guidance
[00:16:01 - 00:16:10] ensures our safety and the fulfillment of His purpose. True victory often emerges not from comfort,
[00:16:10 - 00:16:18] but from the fires of perseverance and faith. Hebrews 1036 reminds us that we need endurance.
[00:16:19 - 00:16:24] For after we have fulfilled God's will, we will receive His promise.
[00:16:25 - 00:16:33] Endurance is not a passive state. It is an active faith in motion, trusting that God's guidance
[00:16:33 - 00:16:40] will lead us to triumph. Are you currently facing a season where the path forward appears daunting
[00:16:40 - 00:16:49] or unclear? Remember, God's guidance remains steadfast, even amid uncertainty. He perceives the
[00:16:49 - 00:16:56] battles we cannot see, and equips us to remain steadfast until victory is revealed. The account
[00:16:56 - 00:17:05] of the battle against the giants in Joshua 10-8-14 illustrates how God's guidance can transform
[00:17:05 - 00:17:14] a desperate situation into a remarkable victory. When Joshua led Israel into battle, God caused the
[00:17:14 - 00:17:23] sun to stand still, extending the day so they could achieve victory. This miraculous act was not
[00:17:23 - 00:17:30] solely about Israel's might but highlighted God's power to guide them beyond human limitations.
[00:17:31 - 00:17:39] To experience victory through God's guidance, we must be attentive to His voice and follow where He
[00:17:39 - 00:17:50] leads. In John 1027, Jesus states, My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
[00:17:50 - 00:17:57] Listening and responding to His voice is crucial for walking in the victory. He has prepared for us.
[00:17:58 - 00:18:06] God's guidance often challenges us to step outside our comfort zones and trust Him in new ways.
[00:18:07 - 00:18:15] He may prompt us to release what we cling to or to embrace paths we never envisioned for ourselves.
[00:18:15 - 00:18:21] Yet, each act of obedience brings us closer to the victory He has promised.
[00:18:22 - 00:18:32] Isaiah 42-16 proclaims, I will lead the blind by a way they did not know. I will guide them in paths
[00:18:33 - 00:18:39] they have not known. I will make darkness light before them and crooked places straight.
[00:18:39 - 00:18:48] This encapsulates the beauty of God's guidance, transforming the unfamiliar into a realm of victory,
[00:18:48 - 00:18:57] even when the journey seems long and arduous. Reflect on the times you've navigated challenges
[00:18:57 - 00:19:03] only to discover that God's guidance had paved the way for breakthroughs.
[00:19:03 - 00:19:10] The lessons learned, strength gained, and victories achieved all testify to His unwavering faithfulness.
[00:19:11 - 00:19:18] Victory through God's guidance encompasses not just the outcome, but the journey of trusting Him
[00:19:18 - 00:19:26] every step of the way. It involves recognizing His hand in every detail, even when the road is rough.
[00:19:26 - 00:19:33] Are you prepared to trust Him today? Are you ready to follow His lead even when the path is uncertain?
[00:19:33 - 00:19:42] The victory that comes from God's guidance awaits, not because of your strength, but due to His sovereignty.
[00:19:42 - 00:19:48] By aligning ourselves with His Word, listening for His voice and walking in obedience,
[00:19:49 - 00:19:54] we position ourselves to experience the fullness of His victory.
[00:19:54 - 00:20:00] The same God who guided by Him, Joshua, and countless others is guiding you today.
[00:20:02 - 00:20:08] He goes before you, walks alongside you, and leads you toward triumph.
[00:20:09 - 00:20:17] So take heart and trust in the one whose guidance is unfailing. Trust in the God who prepares the way
[00:20:17 - 00:20:25] assures you of His presence and leads you to victory. For His plans are perfect, and His guidance
[00:20:25 - 00:20:33] never falters. Walk boldly in faith, knowing that the one who holds your future is with you every
[00:20:33 - 00:20:40] step of the way. He is the God who turns trials into triumphs and uncertainties into testimonies.
[00:20:41 - 00:20:47] Let us move forward with confidence, resting in the assurance that His promises are unbreakable.
[00:20:48 - 00:20:56] Now I invite everyone listening to join me in prayer. I encourage you to pray along or listen in
[00:20:56 - 00:21:04] faith to receive the blessings of this prayer. Heavenly Father, Almighty God, I exalt you for who you
[00:21:04 - 00:21:14] are, mighty, holy, and everlasting. You speak, and it is done, you command, and it stands firm.
[00:21:14 - 00:21:22] You are the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the one who goes before me and makes
[00:21:22 - 00:21:29] crooked paths straight. You are my refuge and fortress, my God in whom I trust, and I declare
[00:21:29 - 00:21:37] your name above all names. You alone deserve glory, honor, and praise for reigning in majesty and
[00:21:37 - 00:21:44] power. Father, I come before you with a heart full of gratitude. Thank you for being my shepherd,
[00:21:44 - 00:21:53] my guide, and my ever-present help in times of need. I appreciate your unwavering faithfulness,
[00:21:53 - 00:22:00] the love that surrounds me and the grace that sustains me. I am thankful for the ways you have gone
[00:22:00 - 00:22:08] before me, creating paths where none seemed possible. Thank you for the breath in my lungs,
[00:22:08 - 00:22:13] the strength in my body, and the assurance of your presence in my life.
[00:22:15 - 00:22:22] Merciful Father, I seek your forgiveness for every sin I have committed against you. Forgive me for
[00:22:22 - 00:22:30] the times I have disregarded your guidance and pursued my own way. I release every grudge, hurt,
[00:22:30 - 00:22:36] and offense, forgiving those who have wronged me just as you have forgiven me.
[00:22:37 - 00:22:42] Cleanse me from all unrighteousness and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:22:43 - 00:22:51] I ask you to go before me today, and throughout this year, guiding every aspect of my life
[00:22:51 - 00:22:59] with your wisdom and grace, prepare the way and make it straight, removing every barrier and obstacle.
[00:22:59 - 00:23:06] Lead me in paths of righteousness for your name's sake, and grant me the wisdom to follow where you
[00:23:06 - 00:23:14] lead. In the name of Jesus, I rebuke every plan of the enemy that seeks to bring confusion,
[00:23:14 - 00:23:22] delay, or destruction. Let your guidance be my compass and fill me with peace and assurance.
[00:23:22 - 00:23:27] I declare in the mighty name of Jesus that I will walk in victory.
[00:23:28 - 00:23:34] For you, Lord, have already secured the outcome. I speak healing over my body,
[00:23:34 - 00:23:43] mind and spirit, claiming restoration in every broken area. I rebuke sickness, disease,
[00:23:43 - 00:23:52] anxiety, depression, and every attack of the enemy, declaring freedom and wholeness in the name of Jesus.
[00:23:53 - 00:24:00] Father, I pray for your blessings to overflow in my life and the lives of my loved ones.
[00:24:01 - 00:24:08] Cover my family with your protection, shielding us from every attack and scheme of the enemy.
[00:24:08 - 00:24:14] Bless us with health, provision, wisdom, and the joy of your salvation.
[00:24:15 - 00:24:20] Surround us with your favor as a shield and let your light shine upon us.
[00:24:21 - 00:24:28] As I pray this prayer with everyone listening, I am grateful for every heart that is opening before
[00:24:28 - 00:24:36] you right now. We come together in agreement, lifting one another before you, knowing that where
[00:24:36 - 00:24:44] two or three are gathered in your name, you are in the midst. Lord, guide us as we seek your presence.
[00:24:45 - 00:24:52] Go before us in our decisions and grant us the faith to trust in your plans, strengthen us to walk
[00:24:52 - 00:24:59] boldly in your victory and to claim the promises you have spoken over our lives. We stand on your

[00:26:28 - 00:26:35] I urge you to embrace God's grace with an open and repentant heart. Start where you are,
[00:26:36 - 00:26:43] your past does not define you. Jesus came to seek and save the lost. God loves you,
[00:26:43 - 00:26:51] and it is his will that none should perish, but that all come to repentance. Say this simple prayer
[00:26:51 - 00:26:59] for salvation, dear Lord Jesus, I acknowledge that I am a sinner and ask for your forgiveness.
[00:26:59 - 00:27:08] I believe you died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite you into
[00:27:08 - 00:27:18] my heart and life. I want to trust and follow you as my Lord and Savior. Lord Jesus, hear my prayer.
[00:27:18 - 00:27:27] Thank you for saving me. Amen. Now that you have prayed this prayer, consider asking a pastor to
[00:27:27 - 00:27:35] baptize you at a local church to make that decision public. Baptism symbolizes your commitment
[00:27:35 - 00:27:43] to follow Jesus. I encourage you to connect with other believers to learn more about your new life
[00:27:43 - 00:27:51] and deepen your relationship with God. Please feel free to leave your prayer requests in the comments,
[00:27:51 - 00:27:56] so we can present them before God for your blessings and victory.
[00:27:57 - 00:28:04] We invite other believers on this platform and around the world to join us in praying for you
[00:28:04 - 00:28:11] right now. Even if you don't see a reply to your prayer request, know that we are actively
[00:28:11 - 00:28:18] lifting each request to God in accordance with His will. We believe in the power of prayer to
[00:28:18 - 00:28:27] bring comfort, healing and guidance according to God's perfect plan to God be all the glory.
[00:28:27 - 00:28:35] May the grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
